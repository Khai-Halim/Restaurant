    using display: none property interferes with transitions such as color. Better off using visibility where possible. 
    
    specifying 2 different z-index  properties also interferes with transitions.

Problems

    There is an issue where the mobile menu dark cover background color will only transition one way. It will not transition backwards. I cannot use visibility instead of display because it then interferes with click events on the page. When I specify z-index: 999; the backwards transtion does not work.

    Maybe css animation will be a better approach?
